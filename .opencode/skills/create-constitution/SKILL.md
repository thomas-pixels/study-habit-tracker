  Use when the user wants to create or rework the project's constitution, i.e.
  the SPECS/MISSION.md, SPECS/TECH.md, and SPECS/ROADMAP.md files. This skill
  interviews the user to pin down intent before writing any files.
---

You are an interviewer helping the user distill the project's constitution. Your job is to really pin down intent before writing anything to disk.

## Audience: keep it simple

The people working on this project are students who are just learning to
program. They know basic Python, Git, HTML, CSS, and a little JavaScript, but
they are not experts. Keep everything you write simple and friendly.

- Use plain, everyday language. Avoid jargon and technical abbreviations, or
  explain them in one short line if you must use them.
- Keep the whole constitution short. A few clear sentences beat a page of
  rules they won't read.
- Only write down the rules that students can actually understand and follow.
  When presenting the sensible defaults below, describe each one in simple
  words with a short example, and gently drop any the user doesn't really
  understand.
- No React, frameworks, or libraries. The project should use vanilla HTML,
  CSS, and JavaScript (and basic Python where it makes sense). If the user
  mentions a framework, steer them back to the simple option.
- **SQLite is the required persistence layer for this project.** Features that
  store data must use SQLite via Python's built-in `sqlite3` module. No ORMs,
  no cloud databases, no other file-based storage formats. Keep queries simple
  and easy for beginners to read.

## What a constitution is

A constitution is the durable, high-level foundation of the project:

- SPECS/MISSION.md — the project's purpose, values, and non-negotiables
- SPECS/TECH.md — the technology stack, architecture principles, and engineering standards
- SPECS/ROADMAP.md — the planned trajectory: current state, next steps, and long-term vision
- README.md — a concise entry point for developers: what the project is, how to set it up, and where to find the constitution and feature specs

The constitution is not a feature spec. Keep it stable, opinionated, and short. Details of individual features belong in dated feature-spec folders, not here.

## Sensible defaults

Unless the user explicitly pushes back, encode these best practices into SPECS/TECH.md as the project's default engineering standards:

- **Red/Green TDD** — write a failing test first, watch it fail (red), then write the minimal code to make it pass (green), refactor as needed.
- **Spec-driven development** — all work starts from a written specification (requirements/plan/validation); code must trace back to an approved spec.
- **Contracts and strict models over custom logic** — define explicit schemas, contracts, and typed models and prefer them over ad-hoc parsing, regexes, or stringly-typed logic.
- **Strict typing** — strict type checking is on, and type-safety is not traded away for convenience.
- **DRY** — don't repeat yourself; extract shared abstractions at the right seams rather than copying code.
- **Walking skeletons** — deliver the thinnest end-to-end slice of the system first (a walking skeleton), then grow features on it, to prevent feature bloat and premature expansion.
- **Decoupled logging** — comprehensive logging via decorators or similar, keeping business logic separate from logging logic.
- **Simplicity over complexity** — prefer solutions that are simple, elegant, and general; minimise arbitrariness.

Present these as defaults to the user during the Tech interview and record any they accept, adjust, or reject.

## Interview process

Interview the user one area at a time. Ask short, concrete questions and follow up on their answers. Do not dump a huge list of questions at once — build the picture conversationally. For each area, dig until you can answer the area's questions with confidence, then move on.

### 1. Mission
- Why does this project exist? Who is it for?
- What problem does it solve, and what does success look like?
- What values or constraints are non-negotiable? What is explicitly out of scope?

### 2. Tech
- What languages, frameworks, and tools are in use or required?
- What are the architectural principles (e.g. TDD, layering, decorators over mixing concerns)?
- What engineering standards matter here (logging, schemas/contracts over regexes, simplicity over complexity)?

### 3. Roadmap
- What is the current state of the project?
- What are the natural next steps, in order of priority?
- What is the longer-term vision beyond those steps?

## Writing the files

1. Restate your understanding back to the user before writing anything. Confirm you got the intent right.
2. Only then create SPECS/MISSION.md, SPECS/TECH.md, SPECS/ROADMAP.md, and README.md.
3. Keep each file focused and concise. Prefer the user's exact words where possible — this is their constitution.
4. After writing, summarize what you created and note anything left unresolved.

If existing SPECS/ files already exist, ask whether the user wants to replace, merge, or extend them before overwriting anything.
